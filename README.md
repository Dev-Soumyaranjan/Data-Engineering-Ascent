# Data Engineering Ascent 🚀

Welcome to the **Data Engineering Ascent** repository! This is the start of my personal journey in **data engineering**. As I progress through various technologies, tools, and concepts, this repository will evolve with my learning. The structure of this repository will grow progressively as I tackle each new topic in the field of data engineering.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This repository is a dedicated learning log for **data engineering**. It will evolve over time as I explore different aspects of the field, from programming basics to advanced data pipelines. I’m starting from the fundamentals and will build my knowledge step by step, uploading relevant materials and notes along the way.

---

### 📂 Repository Structure

The directory structure is organized as follows:

- **01_Core_Programming**: To cover the essential programming concepts, including Python and other necessary languages.
- **02_Data_Engineering_Core**: Core topics in data engineering, like data modeling, data warehousing, and ETL processes.
- **03_Tools_and_Frameworks**: A place for tools and frameworks I’ll explore, such as Snowflake, Azure Data Factory (ADF), Databricks, and more.
- **04_Interview_Preparation**: Interview-specific resources including data engineering interview questions.
- **05_Reference_Materials**: A curated list of books, articles, and references that aid in my learning process.
- **06_Projects**: Hands-on projects that will be created to apply learned concepts into real-world scenarios.

### ⚙️ How to Use

This repository is a **work in progress**. Here’s how you can expect it to evolve:

- As I learn a new topic, I will add relevant content to the corresponding folder.
- Initially, some folders will be empty since I haven’t tackled those topics yet.
- This repository will **grow** over time, and each folder will be updated with notes, exercises, projects, and relevant materials as I progress.

### 💡 Note

While I use **AI** to improve my English phrasing and paraphrasing, it is essential to note that all the core content has been **genuinely learned** through studying videos, reading materials, and hands-on practice. AI helps me structure my thoughts better, making them clearer and more readable, but the **understanding of concepts comes from my own effort**.

---

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

This repository will include topics and tools such as:

- **Python**: For general programming and automation.
- **SQL**: For database interaction and querying.
- **Snowflake**: For cloud data warehousing.
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: For orchestrating ETL workflows.
- **Databricks**: For big data processing.

As I learn more, this list will expand to include other technologies that are vital for data engineering.

---

### 🚀 Future Plans

- I will **add more topics** and **projects** as I continue to learn.
- The content will be **updated progressively**, starting with foundational topics and building towards more complex concepts.
- **Hands-on projects** will be a key component of this repo, and I will document them as I apply what I learn.

## 🔑 Purpose of `additional_info.md` Files

In addition to the **topic-specific learnings** stored in the `learnings.md` files across different folders (e.g., `python`, `sql`, etc.), this repository also contains **generic/overview information** stored in dedicated `additional_info.md` files for each technology. These files are intended to capture foundational concepts, best practices, and language-specific nuances that are not tied to a specific topic but are essential for a deeper understanding.

### Example Files

- **`python_additional_info.md`**: This file contains general information and best practices related to Python programming, such as:
  - Static type checking in Python using `mypy` and the `typing` module
  - Environment setup tips
  - Python performance optimization techniques
  - General Python best practices

- **`sql_additional_info.md`**: This file provides generic information related to SQL, such as:
  - Database optimization tips
  - Advanced query techniques
  - SQL performance and indexing

These **`additional_info.md`** files serve as a reference guide for fundamental concepts and practices that apply across multiple topics and are valuable for anyone looking to deepen their knowledge beyond specific lessons or projects.
