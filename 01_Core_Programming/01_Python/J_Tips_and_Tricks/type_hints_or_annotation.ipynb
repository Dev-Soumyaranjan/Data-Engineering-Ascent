    "\n",
    "In Python, we can assign any type of value to a variable because Python is dynamically typed. However, to make our code **more readable**, **understandable**, and **less error-prone**, Python introduced the concept of **type hints** (also known as type annotations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Type hints allow us to **explicitly indicate what kind of value** a variable is expected to hold. While Python won‚Äôt enforce these hints during runtime, tools like `mypy` can catch mismatches before your code runs."

    "### üß† Key Takeaways\n",
    "- Type hints are **not mandatory**, but **highly recommended** in professional codebases.\n",
    "- They improve **code clarity**, especially in large projects or when working with teams.\n",
    "- They help with a**utocompletion and better suggestions** in modern IDEs.\n",
    "- Python **does not enforce** type hints at runtime.\n",
    "- Primitive Type Hints like `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool` can be used directly without any imports.\n",
    "- For advanced or collection-based types, such as `List`, `Dict`, `Tuple`, `Set`, or specialized types like `Final`, `Optional`, `Union`, etc., you need to import them from the typing module.\n",
    "  \n",
    "üî∏ Note: In Python 3.9+, you can also use built-in generics like list[int] instead of List[int], but it depends on the Python version and static checkers being used."
