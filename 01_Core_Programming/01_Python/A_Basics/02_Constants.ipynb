    "\n",
    "Sometimes in programming, you come across situations where you need a value that should **stay the same** throughout your script. That‚Äôs where the idea of a **constant** comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many programming languages, there‚Äôs usually a specific keyword like `const` or `final` to define constants. But Python works a bit differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ How Constants Work in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does **not** have a built-in keyword to declare constants. Instead, it follows a **naming convention**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> To declare a constant in Python, name the variable using **all uppercase letters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìñ Real-Life Analogy\n",
    "Think of G = 9.8 as how we treat physical constants in science. We don‚Äôt change them casually. Similarly, in Python, constants are values you agree not to modify throughout the program.\n"

    "\n",
    "Since Python is a **dynamically typed language**, it doesn‚Äôt enforce strict rules on variable types or values.  \n",
    "This means that **even if you declare a constant using uppercase letters**, Python will still **allow you to reassign a new value** to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But regardless of this, we can give other programmers a **strong hint** that a particular value **should not change** by using the **uppercase naming convention**.  \n",
    "This is a widely accepted practice, and most developers will **treat such variables as constants** out of discipline and readability."
