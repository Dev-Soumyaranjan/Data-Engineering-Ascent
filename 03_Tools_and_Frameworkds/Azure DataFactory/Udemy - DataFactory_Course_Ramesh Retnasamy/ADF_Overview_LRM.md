# 🔁 LRM Framework: ADF Overview

## 🔹 Learned (Concepts)

The high-level purpose of ADF, project context, architecture, storage options, and transformation tooling.

### 🔍 Reflect

1. **The "Why" Behind ADF**
   - ADF's serverless nature allows you to focus on pipeline creation without managing infrastructure. This makes it scalable and cost-efficient as Microsoft handles compute resources.
  
   - ADF integrates well with other Azure services (like ADLS and Azure SQL Database), making it a powerful choice for hybrid environments.

   - For transforming data, ADF provides low-code solutions via Mapping Data Flows, which is useful for non-complex transformations. For more complex tasks, you can use Databricks or HDInsight.
  
      > ADF shines when you want tight Azure ecosystem integration + managed, scalable orchestration without worrying about infra.

1. **Serverless Nature?**
   - You noted it's serverless—but what does that mean in cost & scaling?
  
      > You don’t provision clusters. Microsoft handles scale, infra, retries, and monitoring. You're billed per activity run and integration runtime usage—not for compute you keep idle.

2. **Mapping Data Flows vs Databricks vs HDInsight – Dig Deeper**

| Use Case                                                  | Tool                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Business Rule–based Transformations (joins, derived cols) | ADF Mapping Data Flows |
| Large-scale, iterative, or ML pre-processing              | Databricks             |
| Legacy Hadoop or Hive jobs                                | HDInsight              |

### 🧠 Master

✅ Real-World Case Scenario
Scenario:
You're at a healthcare startup. You receive daily COVID case data in CSV from multiple regions via FTP and API. The data needs cleansing, enrichment with population data, and publishing into Power BI dashboards.

Q: How would you design this pipeline using ADF and supporting services?

**Your expected flow:**

- Ingest from FTP/API (use Linked Services + Pipelines).
- Drop raw data in ADLS Gen2.
- Use Mapping Data Flows for basic joins and cleansing.
- Store clean output in Azure SQL DB.
- Schedule pipeline daily using Triggers.

### Interview Questions

**1. What makes ADF "serverless" and how does that help with pipeline design?**

- ADF abstracts away infrastructure management by being serverless. You focus on building and executing pipelines without worrying about scaling or managing servers. Microsoft handles compute resources, and you are billed per activity run and integration runtime usage.

**2. In a given use case, how would you choose between ADLS and Azure SQL DB?**

- ADLS is chosen for unstructured data or large data lake scenarios, where you store raw or processed data before further use. Azure SQL DB is chosen for structured, transactional data or when you need relational storage for reporting purposes, like for Power BI dashboards.

**3. Can you describe a complete ADF pipeline for ingesting and transforming real-world data?**

- ADF pipeline starts by defining linked services for connecting to source and destination (HTTP connector for COVID stats, Blob Storage for population).

- Activities: Fetch data (Copy activity), store in ADLS, then use Mapping Data Flows to cleanse the data (e.g., join population with case data), and finally store the transformed data in Azure SQL DB for reporting.

**3. Why would you use Databricks instead of Mapping Data Flows?**

- Mapping Data Flows are ideal for simple, low-code transformations, while Databricks is better for complex, performance-intensive transformations that require Spark-based processing, custom logic, or iterative operations (e.g., for machine learning).

**4. How does ADF compare to SSIS for data integration?**

- SSIS is often used on-premises, whereas ADF is cloud-native and designed for cloud-based integrations. ADF offers better scalability, is fully managed, and integrates seamlessly with other Azure services, while SSIS would require you to handle infrastructure and scaling.

### Key Takeaways

- ADF's No-Code vs. Code-Based Transformations: Low-complexity, easy transformations can be achieved with Mapping Data Flows, whereas complex tasks may require Databricks or HDInsight.

- Storage Considerations: When designing your pipeline, always weigh the nature of your data and the operational needs before choosing storage solutions like ADLS or Azure SQL DB.
